# 🩺 MediBuddy Insurance Data Analysis & Prediction

This project involves the analysis and prediction of insurance pricing using real-world data from **MediBuddy**. The goal is to build a clean, interpretable, and efficient machine learning pipeline to understand key patterns and predict outcomes accurately.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Merged two datasets: personal details and insurance pricing (based on policy numbers)
- Performed data cleaning, including handling missing values and duplicates
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
- Evaluated models using R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Random Forest Regressor** outperformed other models
- Key evaluation metrics:
  - **R² Score**: High accuracy
  - **MAE**: Low error rate
